"Savant IDE comes with the following sample smart contracts written in "
"Scilla:"
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-trial.rst:33
msgid ""
"**HelloWorld** : It is a simple contract that allows a specified account "
"denoted ``owner`` to set a welcome message. Setting the welcome message "
"is done via  ``setHello (msg: String)``. The contract also provides an "
"interface ``getHello()`` to allow any account to be  returned with the "
"welcome message when called."
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-trial.rst:39
msgid ""
"**BookStore** : A demonstration of a CRUD app. Only ``owner`` of the "
"contract can add ``members``. All ``members`` will have read/write access"
" capability to create OR update books in the inventory with `book title`,"
" `author`, and `bookID`."
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-trial.rst:43
msgid ""
"**CrowdFunding** : Crowdfunding implements a Kickstarter-style campaign "
"where users can donate funds to the contract using ``Donate()``. If the "
"campaign is successful, i.e., enough money is raised within a given time "
"period, the raised money can be sent to a predefined account ``owner`` "
"via ``GetFunds()``.  Else, if the campaign fails, then contributors can "
"take back their donations via the transition ``ClaimBack()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-trial.rst:50
msgid ""
"**Auction** : A simple open auction contract where bidders can make their"
" bid using ``Bid()``, and the highest and winning bid amount goes to a "
"predefined account. Bidders who don't win can take back their bid using "
"the transition ``Withdraw()``. The organizer of the auction can claim the"
" highest bid by invoking the transition ``AuctionEnd()``."

#: ../scilla-trial.rst:56

"**FungibleToken** : ZRC-2 Fungible token standard contract for creating "
"fungible digital assets such as stablecoins, utility tokens, and loyalty "
"points."

"**NonFungible Token** : ZRC-1 Non-fungible token standard contract for "
"creating unique digital assets such as digital collectibles, music "
"records, arts, and domains."
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-trial.rst:62
msgid ""
"**ZilGame** : A two-player game where the goal is to find the closest "
"preimage of a given SHA256 digest (``puzzle``). More formally, given a "
"digest `d`, and two values `x` and `y`, `x` is said to be a closer "
"preimage than `y` of `d` if Distance(SHA-256(x), d) < "
"Distance(SHA-256(y), d), for some `Distance` function. The game is played"
" in two phases. In the first phase, players submit their hash,  i.e., "
"SHA-256(x) and SHA-256(y) using the transition ``Play(guess: ByStr32)``."
"  Once the first player has submitted her hash, the second player has a "
"bounded time to submit her hash. If the second player does not submit her"
" hash within the stipulated time, then the first player may become the "
"winner. In the second phase, players have to submit the corresponding "
"values ``x`` or ``y`` using the transition ``ClaimReward(solution: "
"Int128)``. The player submitting the closest preimage is declared the "
"winner and wins a reward. The contract also provides a transition "
"``Withdraw ()`` to recover funds and send to a specified ``owner`` in "
"case no player plays the game."
