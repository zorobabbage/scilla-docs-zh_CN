"`Scilla` (short for `Smart Contract Intermediate-Level LAnguage`) is an "
"intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for the "
"`Zilliqa <https://zilliqa.com>`_ blockchain.  Scilla is designed as a "
"principled language with smart contract safety in mind."
msgstr "`Scilla`（即 `Smart Contract Intermediate-Level LAnguage`）是为 `Zilliqa <https://zilliqa.com>`_ 区块链开发的中级智能合约语言。Scilla被设计成一种有原则的语言，并充分考虑了智能合约的安全性。"

"Scilla imposes a structure on smart contracts that will make applications"
" less vulnerable to attacks by eliminating certain known vulnerabilities "
"directly at the language-level. Furthermore, the principled structure of "
"Scilla will make applications inherently more secure and amenable to "
"formal verification."
msgstr "Scilla在智能合约上强加了一种结构，通过直接在语言级别消除某些已知的漏洞，使应用程序不那么容易受到攻击。此外，Scilla的原则性结构将使应用程序本质上更加安全，并易于接受形式验证。"

"The language is being developed hand-in-hand with formalization of its "
"semantics and its embedding into the `Coq proof assistant "
"<https://coq.inria.fr/>`_ — a state-of-the art tool for mechanized proofs"
" about properties of programs. Coq is  based on advanced dependently-"
"typed theory and features a large set of mathematical libraries.  It has "
"been successfully applied previously to implement certified (i.e., fully "
"mechanically verified) compilers, concurrent and distributed "
"applications, including blockchains among others."
msgstr "该语言正在与语义形式化以及将其嵌入 `Coq证明助手 <https://coq.inria.fr/>`_ （一种用于对程序属性进行机械化证明的先进工具）一起开发。Coq基于高级的依赖类型理论，并以大量的数学库为特征。它之前已经成功应用于实现认证(即完全机械验证)编译器、并发和分布式应用程序，其中就包括区块链等。"

"`Zilliqa` --- the underlying blockchain platform on which Scilla "
"contracts are run --- has been designed to be scalable. It employs the "
"idea of sharding to validate transactions in parallel. Zilliqa has an "
"intrinsic token named `Zilling` (ZIL for short) that are required to run "
"smart contracts on Zilliqa."
msgstr "`Zilliqa`是一个被设计为可扩展的，Scilla合约在其上运行的基础区块链平台。它采用分片的思想进行并行事务验证。Zilliqa有一个名为 `Zilling` （简称ZIL）的内置通证，此通证需要在Zilliqa上运行智能合约。"

"Scilla is under active research and development and hence parts of the "

"currently comes with an interpreter binary that has been integrated into "
"two Scilla-specific web-based IDEs. :ref:`trial-label` presents the "
