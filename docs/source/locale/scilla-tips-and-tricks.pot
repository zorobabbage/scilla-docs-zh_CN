#: ../scilla-tips-and-tricks.rst:17
msgid "If your contract needs to know the size of a field map, i.e. a field variable that is a map then the obvious implementation that reads a field map into a variable and applies the ``size`` builtin (as in the following code snippet) can be very inefficient as it requires making a copy of the map in question."
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-tips-and-tricks.rst:34
msgid "In order to solve the issue one tracks the size information in a corresponding field variable as in the following code snippet. Notice that now instead of copying a map one just reads from ``accounts_size`` field variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-tips-and-tricks.rst:52
msgid "Now, to make sure that the map and its size stay in sync, one needs to update the size of the map when using the builtin in-place statements like ``m[k] := v`` or ``delete m[k]`` or better yet define and use systematically procedures that do exactly that."

#: ../scilla-tips-and-tricks.rst:101
msgid "Let's say you are working on a contract which lets people tips each other. Naturally, you'd like to avoid a situation when a person tips too much because of a typo. It would be nice to ask Scilla to accept incoming funds partially, but there is no ``accept <cap>`` builtin. You can either not accept at all or accept the funds fully. We can work around this restriction by fully accepting the incoming funds and then immediately refunding the tipper if the tip exceeds some cap."

msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-tips-and-tricks.rst:152
msgid "If your contract has an owner (usually it means someone with admin powers like adding/removing user accounts or pausing/unpausing the contract) which can be changed at runtime then at first sight this can be formalized in the code as a field ``owner`` and a transition like ``ChangeOwner``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-tips-and-tricks.rst:170
msgid "However, this might lead to a situation when the current owner gets locked out of the control over the contract. For instance, the current owner can potentially transfer contract ownership to a non-existing address due to a typo in the address parameter when calling the ``ChangeOwner`` transition. Here we provide a design pattern to circumvent this issue."
msgstr ""

#: ../scilla-tips-and-tricks.rst:176
msgid "One way to ensure the new owner is active is to do ownership transfer in two phases:"
